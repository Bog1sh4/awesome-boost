## General notes

Players count depends on gamemode which runs server, so not all players like all mods.
Most popular ones are public, deathmatch, gungame and respawn modes which will bring you more player, and less players-liked are fun modes like zombie modes, furien...

Time is also major factor in player count, late night is always bad for boosting if you want to attract more players.
